# K-Pop Demon Hunters (Starter Kit)

This is a Phaser-powered browser game scaffold inspired by **K-pop Demon Hunters**. It is set up to be playful enough for a young collaborator while leaving lots of room for custom art, audio, and story ideas.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or newer recommended). Installing Node also gives you `npm`.
2. Inside this folder run:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the printed URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

> Tip: `npm run build` creates a production bundle, and `npm run preview` lets you test the built files locally.

## Project Layout

- `index.html` – Minimal HTML shell that boots the Phaser game.
- `src/main.ts` – Game entry point, configures Phaser and loads the main scene.
- `src/scenes/MainScene.ts` – Core gameplay loop (movement, demons, scoring, game over).
- `assets/` – Drop your custom sprites and audio files here. See `assets/README.md` for details.
- `docs/roadmap.md` – Ideas for future expansions and learning quests.

## Next Steps

- Replace the placeholder squares with your own hero and demon designs.
- Add new attacks or special abilities in `MainScene`.
- Use the roadmap and asset guide to plan collaborative coding sessions with your young teammate.
