# K-Pop Demon Hunters – Future Ideas

These notes capture feature ideas for follow-up coding sessions. Pick whichever sounds exciting next!

## Polishing the core

- Swap placeholder squares with custom hero/demon art and matching hitboxes.
- Add walking/attack animations (Phaser sprite sheets or Spine exports).
- Build a title screen with a “Start Adventure” button and instructions.

## New gameplay beats

- Boss battles: giant demon that teleports, shoots projectiles, or shields minions.
- Power-ups: glowing orbs that boost speed, grant temporary shields, or unleash special attacks.
- Soul meter: collect spirit shards to trigger a “K-pop dance blast” finisher.

## World building

- Background layers featuring neon cityscapes, magical forests, or concert stages.
- Dialogue pop-ups between fights to tell the Demon Hunters story.
- Friendly NPCs who offer items, mini quests, or even rhythm challenges.

## Tech upgrades

- Mobile controls with on-screen buttons or swipe gestures.
- Save progress locally (localStorage) so the hero keeps their score and upgrades.
- Multiplayer experiments: two heroes on the same keyboard or online via WebSockets.

## Learning quests for the 7-year-old sidekick

- Change the hero speed numbers and see how it feels.
- Draw a new demon on paper, digitise it, and import the sprite.
- Record custom sound effects together and drop them into `assets/audio/`.
